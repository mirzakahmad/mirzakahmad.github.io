						<h2>FPV Drone Project (2022)</h2>
					</header>

					<!-- Content -->
						<section id="content">
							<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/FPV drone.png" alt="" /></a>

							<p>My fascination with drones began at a young age; the only things stopping me were a low budget and my understanding of structures and electronics. I began my journey by learning about the electronics, machinery, resources, and costs needed to construct anything of this nature.</p>
							<p>I collaborated on this project at Discord with other enthusiasts to develop a ridged frame with a low frame resonance. Excessive gyro noise brought on by high resonance in the frame may result in overheated or burned motors. The goal was to minimize gyro noise without using excessive gyro filters, too much gyro filtering can induce stick latency. After running simulations and analyzing gyro data from test runs, one of the design solutions we came up with was to stiffen the arms' torsional joints to reduce resonance peaks at higher frequencies.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Stage 1: Assembling the carbon fibre frame which was CNC machined.</li><br>
								<li>Stage 2: soldering motors to esc and other electronics such as the video transmitter, receiver and camera were soldered to the flight controller board.</li><br>
								<li>Stage 3: configuring the quad on betaflight software such as tuning the PIDs (Proportional, Integral, Derivative), as well as adding safety features, and calibrating the gyro</li><br>
							</ul>
							<p>Video from the camera is sent to the video transmittor or VTX which transmits the live video to a pair of goggles which recieve the video signal at 5.8 ghz frequency and display it onto a screen for first person view of the aircraft. Its like playing a video game in real life, its amazing.</p>
							<li>A non-physical constraint I experienced in this project was local radio laws which prohibit the use of certain frequencies, and also avoiding no fly zones.</li>

						<h2>150mph RC car Project (2021)</h2>
					</header>

						<section id="content">
							<a class="image fit"><img src="images/RC Car.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>Electric vehicles represent a significant step forward. I adore speed and find it fascinating. In essence, this is an Remote controlled version of a hypercar.</p>
							<li>This project was built using an arma roller chassis. The stock centre drive shafts immedtialy had to be strengthened as they would wobble and expand due to high velocity, thicker titanium shafts fixed the issue.</li><br>
							<li>I looked far and wide for a motor that would hold up to the task.
								After some calculations and careful thinking i noticed that the car's combined weight with the batteries in it would be around 13 Kg, which is quite heavy for its scale. I decided to go with an 800KV sensored motor which is the size of a coke can. This was simply the only efficient solution that would make up for the weight and provide the torque to reach peak speed without any overheating problems.</li><br>
							<li>Considering the vehicle's mass, i knew that the motor would draw alot of amps; therefore the motor is controlled by a 500 amp rated esc, which has blackbox logging for data analysis of voltage sag, motor/esc temps, rpm, throttle map and more.</li><br>
							<li>Finding a battery with a high energy density while being as light as possbile was a challenge. Lithium Polymer or LiPo batteries have a high "C" rating, which is the maximum safe discharge rate, so i went with two 4 cell LiPo batterys connected in series to total 33.6 V.</li><br>
							<li>A physical constraints i encountered while working on this project was finding a straight, flat and long track .</li><br>
							<li>During testing, I had encountered several problems and failed many times such as tyre blowouts, collisions and mechanical failures. Nonetheless, I learned from my mistakes and improved after every test.</li><br>
							<li>Through this project I learned about the importance of downforce, centrifugal forces, and drag. I modified parts of the body like the suspension, wing and front splitter for better stability at high speeds. In my time of testing the car i reached a maximum speed of 120 mph before the car would run out of road, but i know that it can do more because i was never full throttle.</li><br>

						<h2>Telepresence Robot Concept Project (2021)</h2>
					</header>

					<!-- Content -->
						<section id="content">
							<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/telepresence robot.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>This is a project I took part in during my first year of studies at my University. The design department presented a design challenge to come up with an indoor or outdoor robot for the University campus that could interact with users and its surrounding. It could be used as a tour guide or information/assisting robot, as well as direct the flow of people in and out of a building. Tasks i conducted to complete the project:</p>
							<li>A design brief which lists out the problems and the necessary methods used to solve them.</li><br> 
							<li>A user journey map of how the robot would interact with humans, as well as a persona which would paint out an ideal target user.</li><br>
							<li>Robotics and competitor market research</li><br>
							<li>design concept sketches, and product design specification and material choice for the robot</li><br>
							<p>To further develop the chosen design concept, i used Solidworks, which is a widely used CAD sofware by engineers, and i transformed what was on paper into 3D model with moving parts and photo-realistic renders.</p>
							<p>Finally, I built a low fidelity proof-of concept model of what a telepresence robot would look like in real life around people. Although the model was scaled down to 1:3, it proved that it is feasible and gave conifdence to further develop the idea.</p>

					<h2>Model Plane Project (2018)</h2>
				</header>

				<!-- Content -->
					<section id="content">
						<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/model plane.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p>This was one of my first significant projects. I was 15 years old at the time, and I was really interested in flying machines. One thing that struck out to me was how large aeroplanes could take off and maintain flight. I researched the basic principles of flight, and it was the famous airfoil design. A subject that is directly related to this is fluid mechanics which i am currently studying.</p>
						<p>Initialy my plan was to make just a model, but i developed it further to be flyable. The aircraft is based on a C-212 Aviocar Cargo plane because i love the design.</p>
						<li>The plane was constructed from lightweight 3mm mount board; I marked the cutting lines using a pencil and ruler before cutting along those lines with a utility knife.</li><br>
						<li>A long cross member made out of MDF wood was inserted across the wing for structural stiffness because The plane's wingspan experiences compression stress at the top of the wings and tension stress at the bottom of the wings.</li><br>
						<li>The thrust generators were two 1000kv brushless motors with a 30A esc, and the ailerons, rudder, and elevators were all controlled by servos.</li><br>
						<li>Weight is crucial and the batteries are arguably the heaviest part of the aircraft, I had to position them appropriately to maintain a balanced centre of gravity.</li><br>
