						<h2>FPV Drone project</h2>

							<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/FPV drone.png" alt="" /></a>

							<p>My fascination in drones began at a young age; the only things stopping me were a low budget and my understanding of electronics. I started my project by learning about the electronics, machinery, resources, and costs needed to construct anything of this nature.</p>
							<p>I collaborated on this project on Discord with other enthusiasts to develop a ridged frame with a low frame resonance. Excessive gyro noise brought on by resonance in the frame may result in overheated or burned motors. The goal was to minimise gyro noise without using an excessive gyro filters, which might induce stick latency. After running simulations and analysing gyro data, one of the design solutions we came up with was to stiffen the arms' torsional joints to reduce resonance peaks at higher frequencies.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Stage 1: Assembling the carbon fibre frame which was CNC machined.</li><br>
								<li>Stage 2: soldering motors to esc and other electronics such as the video transmitter, reciever and camera were soldered to the flight controller board.</li><br>
								<li>Stage 3: configuring the quad on betaflight software such as PID tuning, adding safety features and calibrating the gyro</li><br>
							</ul>
							<p>Video from the camera is sent to the video transmittor or VTX which transmits the live video to a pair of goggles which recieve the video signal and display it onto a screen for first person view of the aircraft, its like playing a video game in real life its amazing.</p>
							<li>A non-physical constraint i experienced in this project was local radio laws which prohibit the use of certain frequencies. It is also dangerous to fly a unmanned aircarft in "no fly zones", therefore it is important to research the location before flying and comply with laws.</li>

						<h2>150mph RC car</h2>

							<a class="image fit"><img src="images/RC Car.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>Electric vehicles represent a significant step forward. I adore fast automobiles and find speed to be fascinating. In essence, this is an RC version of a hypercar.</p>
							<li>This project was built using an arma roller chassis. Because the stock centre drive shafts would wobble and expand due to the velocity, thicker titanium shafts were installed in their place.</li><br>
							<li>I looked far and wide for a motor that would hold up to the task.
								After some calculations i noticed that the car's combined weight with the batteries in it would be around 13 KG, which is a lot for a model car. I decided to go with a 800KV sensored motor which is the size of a coke can. This was simply the only efficient solution that would make up for the weight while maintaining peak speed without any overheating problems.</li><br>
							<li>Considering the vehicle's mass, i knew that the motor would draw alot of amps, therefore the motor is controlled by a 500 amp rated esc, which has blackbox logging for data analysing.</li><br>
							<li>Certain physical constraints i experiecned while working on this project was finding a track that was straight and long enough without too many imperfections such as mini pot holes and cracks.</li><br>
							<li>While testing this vehicle, I had several problems, including tyre blowouts and collisions because the car wasn't tilted forward enough to prevent it from catching air from the bottom and becoming airborne at 95 mph. nonetheless, i started to understand the fundamentals of kinematics and fluid dynamics.</li><br>
							<li>Through this project i learnt about different forces that act on the vehicle such as downforce, centrifugal forces and drag, i modified parts of the body like the wing and front splitter for better stability at high speeds. in my time of testing the car i reached a maximum of 120 mph as it would run out of road, but i know that it has alot more because i was never full throttle.</li><br>

						<h2>Telepresence Robot Concept</h2>

						<section id="content">
							<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/telepresence robot.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>This is a project i took part in during my first year of studies at UOG. The design department presented a design challenge to come up with a indoor or outdoor robot that could interact with users and its surrounding, it could be used as a tour guide or information/asisting robot, as well as direct the flow of people in and out of a building. some of the work for this project includes:</p>
							<li>Writing a design brief which listed out the problems and the nessecery methods used to solve them.</li><br> 
							<li>A user journey map of how the robot would interact with humans, as well as a persona which would paint out an ideal target user.</li><br>
							<li>Robotics and competitor market research</li><br>
							<li>design concept sketches, and product design specification and material choice for the robot</li><br>
							<p>To further develop the chosen design concept, i used Solidworks which is a widely used cad sofware by engineers, and i transformed what was on paper to a 3D model with moving parts and photo realisitc renders. Finally i decided to build a low fedelity proof of concept model of what a telepresence robot would look like in real life around people. Although model was scaled down to 1:3, it gave a sense of how it would move around in buildings and around corridors.</p>

					<h2>Model Plane</h2>

				<!-- Content -->
					<section id="content">
						<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/model plane.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p>One of my first significant projects was this. I was 15 years old at the time, and I was really interested in flying machines. One thing that struck out to me was how large aeroplanes could take off and maintain flight. So i spent many hours researching the basic principle of flight and it was the famous airfoil design, i dived a little more into the phenomenon and found alot of interesting information on the subject of fluid mechanics.</p>
						<p>initialy my plan was to make just a model but i developed it further to be flyable. The aircraft is based of a C-212 Aviocar Cargo plane because i loved the design and role of this aircraft in service.</p>
						<li>The plane was constructed from lightweight 3mm mountboard; I marked the cutting lines using a pencil and ruler before cutting along those lines with a utility knife.</li><br>
						<li>A long length of MDF board was put across the wing for structural stiffness since the aircraft's wingspan, which is around 1.5 metres long, needed to be strengthened to support the weight of the craft.</li><br>
						<li>The thrust generators were two cheap 1000kv brushless motors with a 30A esc, and the ailerons, rudder, and elevators were all controlled by servos.</li><br>
						<li>All flying machines need to be lightweight and strong. Since the batteries are the heaviest part of the aircraft, I had to position them appropriately to maintain a balanced centre of gravity.</li><br>
